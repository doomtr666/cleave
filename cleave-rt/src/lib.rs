//! The Rust-implemented half of cleave's `extern fn` stdlib. Each function
//! here is compiled directly into the `cleave` binary itself (an ordinary
//! path dependency, not a separately loaded shared library) and registered
//! with the JIT `ExecutionEngine` by real function pointer (see `main.rs`'s
//! `--run` path) — no dynamic symbol lookup by name involved, sidestepping
//! the Windows/MSVC CRT-symbol-visibility questions a raw libc binding would
//! have run into.
//!
//! `extern "C"` on each function is the calling-convention marker MLIR's own
//! generated `func.call`/`llvm.call` needs to match; it's required
//! regardless of how the pointer reaches the JIT.
